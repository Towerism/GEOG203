* Ch1: Essentials of Geography
** The Science of Goegraphy
*** Geography - Greek term:
- *geo* "Earth"
- *graphein* "to write"
*** Geography is a method, not a body of knowledge
*** Method -> *spatial* analysis
- e.g. GIS
- *spatial* characteristics of physical space, its measurement, distribution of
  things within
*** Five spatial themes:
**** #1 Location
- Absolute and relative location on earth
- Where? The specific planetary address
- E.g latitude and longitude
**** #2 Region
- Areas having unfiorm characteristics
- How they form and change
- Relation to other regions
- E.g. areas that are favorable to hurricane formation
**** #3 Movement
- Communication, movement, circulation, migration, and diffusion across Earth's
  surface
- Global interdependence links all regions and places
- Not necessarily people, but can refer to weather, and natural disaster
- E.g. the path/trajectory of a hurricane, or the rotation
**** #4 Place
- Tangible, intangible living and nonliving characteristics that make each
  place unique
- No two places on earth are exactly alike
- E.g. memories of previous hurricanes, emotions and trauma
**** #5 Human-Earth Relationships
- Human-environment connections inlucde
  - Resource exploitation
  - Hazard perception
  - Environmental pollution and modification
- E.g. aftermath of a hurricane, or human actions that influence hurricane
  formation
*** Geographic Continuum
**** Geography is "eclectic"
- Any subject can be examined geographically
**** Continuum
- Physical and life sciences on end
  - E.g. biogeography, climatology, zoogeography, etc.
- Human and cultural sciences at the other
  - E.g. behavioral geography, economic geography, political geography, etc.
** Earth Systems Concepts
*** Systems theory
- *System* any ordered set of interrelated components and their attributions
- Can be made up of sub-systems
**** Open systems
- Not self-contained; inputs/outputs of energy / matter
- Most systems are open
- E.g. process of photosynthesis
**** Closed systems
- No external influences; shut off from surroundings
- E.g. the earth is closed in terms of matter
  - The earth is NOT a closed system in terms of energy
- Otherwise it is very difficult to think of any kind of closed system
**** System feedbacks
- Outputs that influence the system to discourage or encourage further outputs
***** Negative feedbacks
- E.g pushing a boulder up a steep hill
- E.g. Global warming
  - Initial warming could make the world a bit colder
***** Positive feedbacks
- E.g. pushing a boulder down a steep hill
- E.g. initial temperature increase in snow
  - warmer snow has lower albedo and absorbs more sunlight, becoming even warmer
  - warmer snow in turn warms surrounding snow
- "Domino effect"
  - Initial input causes a "snowball" effect
**** System equilibrium
***** *Steady state equilibrium*
Most systems are in *equilibrium* their conditions fluctuate around average conditions
E.g. water vapor in the atmosphere
***** *Dynamic equilibrium*
If there is a trend over time
E.g. CO2 in the atmosphere
***** *Meta-stable equilibrium*
Abrupt change or tipping point
**** What are Earth's Systems?
***** Four Spheres interact across *500 million km^2*
- Abiotic (non-living)
  - Atmosphere
  - Hydrosphere
  - Lithosphere
- Bitotic (living): all three abiotic spheres intersect
  - Biosphere
** Location and Time on Earth
*** Dimensions
**** Spherical Planet: Earth's Dimensions
- Due to its rotation
  - Earth is not perfectly round (thicker along the equator)
  - Diameter
    - Equatorial is larger than the north-south diameter (by about 26 mi)
**** Geographic Grid
***** Latiude and Longitude
- Degrees, minutes, seconds, direction
- 0 to 180 longitude
- or 0 to 90 latitude
- 00' to 59' minutes
- 00" to 59" seconds
- N, S, E, W for direction
*** Latitude
- "Angular distance north or sourth of the equator," measured from the center of Earth
- 1 degree is *always ~69 mi*
**** Runs =east to west= on maps/globes
- Parallel to the equator (0 deg)
- Increase northward and southward
  - North Pole = 90 deg N
  - South Pole = 90 deg S
- Lines of latitude are called "parallels"
**** Latidunical Geographic Zones
- Climate latitudes
- E.g. Arctic circle: 66.5 deg N to North pole
- E.g. Antarctic circle: 66.5 deg S to South pole
- E.g. Tropic of Cancer and Capricorn: 23.5 deg N and S respectively
*** Longitude
- "Angular distance east or west of a point on the Earth's surface," measured
  from the center of Earth
- 1 degree *varies, 0-69 mi* (0 at the north pole, 69 at the equator)
**** Measured relative to prime meridian (0 deg)
- Arbitrarily designated to be Greenwich, England
**** Run =north to south= on maps/globes
- Lines of longitude are called meridians
- They are *not* parallel to each other
- Meridians make right angles with the parallels (latitudes)
*** Prime Meridian and Standard Time
**** Prime merdian, also the standard for time
- Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) = Universal Time
**** Time Zones
- Earth rotates 360 deg in 24 hours
  - *1 hour* = *1 time zone* -> 360 deg / 24 hours = *15 deg wide*
  - Time zone extends 7.5 deg (15 / 2) on either side of a central meridian
- From west to east, it gets later
**** National/political boundaries distort the time zones
- Various economic and political reasons
- Some countries don't dollow the rules
  - China spans 3-4 time zones
  - Some countries observe non-standard time such as India and parts of Australia
**** International Date Line
- Where each day officially begins and sweeps westward
- Opposite the prime meridian
- West side is always one day ahead/later
- No matter what time of day you cross it, the date changes
- Remember it is a longitude line, which is inside a time zone (15 deg wide)
** Maps, Scales, and Projections
*** Map
- *Def* Generalized view of an area seen from above and reduced in size
*** Scale
- *Def* Ratio of map unites to ground units
- Representative fraction (1:250,000)
- or Graphic Scale
*** Projection
- *Def* process of transforming spherical Earth to flat map
- Often introduces distortion
**** Example
***** Mercator
- Areas are more distorted the farther they are from the equator
- Exercise: [[http://thetruesize.com]]
**** Equal area... or true shape?
- Can't have both on the same map
- Trade off between correct area and correct shape
***** Equal area
- Have to stretch and shear -> parallels and meridians are no longer and right angles
***** True shape
- Scale varies from region to region across the map
**** Correct projection depends on intended use
**** Types examples
***** Cylindrical
- True shape
- Right angles
- Midlatitudes and polar areas are vastly exaggerated in size -> not equal aread
- Standard line (equator on Mercator line), minimized distortion
***** Planar
- Equal area
- Standard line (point) at north pole
***** Conic
- Equal area
- Two standard parallels
** Remote Sensing and GPS
*** Remote Sensing (RS)
**** Gathering of info about objects/surfaces that are not in direct pyhsical contact
- Aircraft, spacecraft, satellites, ships, etc.
**** RS instruments are differnet portions of the electromagnetic spectrum
- Humans can only see visible spectrum
- RS can also "see" wavelengths in the ultraviolet, infrared, and/or microwave
  range
**** Satellites
***** Three types of orbits
- *Geostationary*, or geosynchronous
  - Pace the earth's rotation speed and remain "parked" over the same location
    (usually the equator)
  - Highest altitude (polar and sun-synchronous are much lower)
- *Polar*
  - Rotate north-south around earth, as earth spins under it
  - Orbit once every 90 minutes
- *Sun-synchronous*
  - Like polar-orbiters, but they shift their track slightly (1 deg) every day,
    so that they're always in daylight
***** Two types of remote sensing
- *Active* remote sensing
  - Provide their own engergy to "actively" send out a beam of enerygy, and then
    read or analyze what is sent back
  - E.g. radar
  - Can see the surface through clouds and debris, unlike passive RS
- *Passive* remote sensing
  - Record the natural radiation emitted or reflected from a surface ->
    "passively wait for surface to emit its energy
  - Primarily visible and infrared light
  - E.g. areal photographs (non-flash)
  - Can give you the visual representation, unlike active RS
*** Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
**** Remote sensing produces vast quantities of spatial data...
**** GIS combines spatial and attribute data
**** Maps can contain multiple data layers
- Physical features
- Cultural features
**** Layers are added to create composite overlay
- Combining maps to aggregate all the relevant data
* Ch2: Solar Energy to Earth and the Seasons
** The Solar System, Sun, and Earth
*** Speed of light
- Travels at 300,000 km/s = 9.5 trillion km/year -> *Light year*
**** Moon is 384,400 km (238,866 mi) away
  - 1.28 light seconds away
**** Solar system
  - 11 light hours in diameter
**** Milky way galaxy
  - 100,000 light years across
**** Universe
  - 12 billion light years across
*** Dimensions and distances
**** Earth's orbit
- Plane of Earth's orbit = *Plane of the ecliptic*
- Average distance from Earth to Sun: 150,000,000 km
  - About 8:20 minutes from the Sun
  - Closest in January (Perihelion)
  - Farthest on July 4 (Aphelion)
  - *Distance from Earth to Sun does not have a strong effect on seasonality*
** Solar Energy: From Sun to Earth
*** Solar activity and solar wind
**** Energy/radiation coming from sun is key to life
**** Sun 'produces'
- *Sunspots* caused by magnetic storms (huge, often bigger than size of earth)
  - activity cycle of ~11 years (maximum and minimum of radiation)
- *Solar wind* streams of electrically charged particles
  - Earth's magnetosphere deflects it toward poles
  - Neutralized in the atmosphere, doesn't reach the surface
  - Responsible for the Aurora Borealis (which is why it's only seen in the
    higher latitudes)
- *Radiation* energy in the form of *electromagnetic waves*
  - Made up of different wavelengths (short and long waves refer to wavelength)
    - *wavelength* distance over which a wave's shape repeats
    - *frequency* number of waves per unit time
  - All objects radiate energy in wavelengths related to their _temperature_
*** Electromagnetic spectrum
- Wavelengths shorter than visible light spectrum are very harmful to humans
  (ultra-violet and shorter)
- Visible light (0.4 micrometers to 0.7 micrometers)
- Wavelengths longer than visible spectrum (infrared and longer)
**** All objects with a *temperature greater than absolute zero* radiate energy
- Absolute zero = *0 Kelven (0K)* = *-273 deg C* = *-460 deg F*
**** Sun = temperature of 6000K -> emits a lot of radiation
- Hot enough to give off shortwave radiation, aka *solar radiation*
- Nothing else in the solar system is hot enough to do this
- 8% ultraviolet, 47% visible, 45% infrared (all shortwave)
**** Earth = temperature of 288K -> emits a lot less
- Longwave radiation, aka *terrestrial radiation*
- All infrared (all shortwave)
**** Earth's Energy Budget
- *Solar constant* 1372 W/m^2
- Earth absorbs shortwave from the sun
- Earth then converts the energy to longwave energy and emits that
*** Insolation
** The Seasons
*** Seasonality
*** Reasons for seasons
*** Annual march of the seasons
