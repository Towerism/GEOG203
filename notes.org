* Ch1: Essentials of Geography
** The Science of Goegraphy
*** Geography - Greek term:
- *geo* "Earth"
- *graphein* "to write"
*** Geography is a method, not a body of knowledge
*** Method -> *spatial* analysis
- e.g. GIS
- *spatial* characteristics of physical space, its measurement, distribution of
  things within
*** Five spatial themes:
**** #1 Location
- Absolute and relative location on earth
- Where? The specific planetary address
- E.g latitude and longitude
**** #2 Region
- Areas having unfiorm characteristics
- How they form and change
- Relation to other regions
- E.g. areas that are favorable to hurricane formation
**** #3 Movement
- Communication, movement, circulation, migration, and diffusion across Earth's
  surface
- Global interdependence links all regions and places
- Not necessarily people, but can refer to weather, and natural disaster
- E.g. the path/trajectory of a hurricane, or the rotation
**** #4 Place
- Tangible, intangible living and nonliving characteristics that make each
  place unique
- No two places on earth are exactly alike
- E.g. memories of previous hurricanes, emotions and trauma
**** #5 Human-Earth Relationships
- Human-environment connections inlucde
  - Resource exploitation
  - Hazard perception
  - Environmental pollution and modification
- E.g. aftermath of a hurricane, or human actions that influence hurricane
  formation
*** Geographic Continuum
**** Geography is "eclectic"
- Any subject can be examined geographically
**** Continuum
- Physical and life sciences on end
  - E.g. biogeography, climatology, zoogeography, etc.
- Human and cultural sciences at the other
  - E.g. behavioral geography, economic geography, political geography, etc.
** Earth Systems Concepts
*** Systems theory
- *System* any ordered set of interrelated components and their attributions
- Can be made up of sub-systems
**** Open systems
- Not self-contained; inputs/outputs of energy / matter
- Most systems are open
- E.g. process of photosynthesis
**** Closed systems
- No external influences; shut off from surroundings
- E.g. the earth is closed in terms of matter
  - The earth is NOT a closed system in terms of energy
- Otherwise it is very difficult to think of any kind of closed system
**** System feedbacks
- Outputs that influence the system to discourage or encourage further outputs
***** Negative feedbacks
- E.g pushing a boulder up a steep hill
- E.g. Global warming
  - Initial warming could make the world a bit colder
***** Positive feedbacks
- E.g. pushing a boulder down a steep hill
- E.g. initial temperature increase in snow
  - warmer snow has lower albedo and absorbs more sunlight, becoming even warmer
  - warmer snow in turn warms surrounding snow
- "Domino effect"
  - Initial input causes a "snowball" effect
**** System equilibrium
***** *Steady state equilibrium*
Most systems are in *equilibrium* their conditions fluctuate around average conditions
E.g. water vapor in the atmosphere
***** *Dynamic equilibrium*
If there is a trend over time
E.g. CO2 in the atmosphere
***** *Meta-stable equilibrium*
Abrupt change or tipping point
**** What are Earth's Systems?
***** Four Spheres interact across *500 million km^2*
- Abiotic (non-living)
  - Atmosphere
  - Hydrosphere
  - Lithosphere
- Bitotic (living): all three abiotic spheres intersect
  - Biosphere
** Location and Time on Earth
*** Dimensions
**** Spherical Planet: Earth's Dimensions
- Due to its rotation
  - Earth is not perfectly round (thicker along the equator)
  - Diameter
    - Equatorial is larger than the north-south diameter (by about 26 mi)
**** Geographic Grid
***** Latiude and Longitude
- Degrees, minutes, seconds, direction
- 0 to 180 longitude
- or 0 to 90 latitude
- 00' to 59' minutes
- 00" to 59" seconds
- N, S, E, W for direction
*** Latitude
- "Angular distance north or sourth of the equator," measured from the center of Earth
- 1 degree is *always ~69 mi*
**** Runs =east to west= on maps/globes
- Parallel to the equator (0 deg)
- Increase northward and southward
  - North Pole = 90 deg N
  - South Pole = 90 deg S
- Lines of latitude are called "parallels"
**** Latidunical Geographic Zones
- Climate latitudes
- E.g. Arctic circle: 66.5 deg N to North pole
- E.g. Antarctic circle: 66.5 deg S to South pole
- E.g. Tropic of Cancer and Capricorn: 23.5 deg N and S respectively
*** Longitude
- "Angular distance east or west of a point on the Earth's surface," measured
  from the center of Earth
- 1 degree *varies, 0-69 mi* (0 at the north pole, 69 at the equator)
**** Measured relative to prime meridian (0 deg)
- Arbitrarily designated to be Greenwich, England
**** Run =north to south= on maps/globes
- Lines of longitude are called meridians
- They are *not* parallel to each other
- Meridians make right angles with the parallels (latitudes)
*** Prime Meridian and Standard Time
**** Prime merdian, also the standard for time
- Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) = Universal Time
**** Time Zones
- Earth rotates 360 deg in 24 hours
  - *1 hour* = 1 time zone -> 360 deg / 24 hours = *15 deg wide*
  - Time zone extends 7.5 deg (15 / 2) on either side of a centra meridian
**** National/political boundaries distort the time zones
** Maps, Scales, and Projections
** Remote Sensing and GPS
