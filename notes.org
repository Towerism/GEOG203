* Ch1: Essentials of Geography
** The Science of Goegraphy
*** Geography - Greek term:
- *geo* "Earth"
- *graphein* "to write"
*** Geography is a method, not a body of knowledge
*** Method: *spatial* analysis
- e.g. GIS
- *spatial* characteristics of physical space, its measurement, distribution of
  things within
*** Five spatial themes:
**** Location
- Abste and relative location on earth
- Whe The specific planetary address
- E.gtitude and longitude
**** Region
- Arehaving unfiorm characteristics
- Howey form and change
- Relon to other regions
- E.greas that are favorable to hurricane formation
**** Movement
- Comication, movement, circulation, migration, and diffusion across Earth's
  sure
- Glo interdependence links all regions and places
- Notcessarily people, but can refer to weather, and natural disaster
- E.ghe path/trajectory of a hurricane, or the rotation
**** Place
- Tanle, intangible living and nonliving characteristics that make each
  plaunique
- No  places on earth are exactly alike
- E.gemories of previous hurricanes, emotions and trauma
**** Human-Earth Relationships
- Human-environment connections inlucde
  - Resource exploitation
  - Hazard perception
  - Environmental pollution and modification
- E.g. aftermath of a hurricane, or human actions that influence hurricane
  formation
*** Geographic Continuum
**** Geography is "eclectic"
- Any subject can be examined geographically
**** Continuum
- Physical and life sciences on end
  - E.g. biogeography, climatology, zoogeography, etc.
- Human and cultural sciences at the other
  - E.g. behavioral geography, economic geography, political geography, etc.
** Earth Systems Concepts
*** Systems theory
- *System* any ordered set of interrelated components and their attributions
- Can be made up of sub-systems
**** Open systems
- Not self-contained; inputs/outputs of energy / matter
- Most systems are open
- E.g. process of photosynthesis
**** Closed systems
- No external influences; shut off from surroundings
- E.g. the earth is closed in terms of matter
  - The earth is NOT a closed system in terms of energy
- Otherwise it is very difficult to think of any kind of closed system
**** System feedbacks
- Outputs that influence the system to discourage or encourage further outputs
***** Negative feedbacks
- E.g pushing a boulder up a steep hill
- E.g. Global warming
  - Initial warming could make the world a bit colder
***** Positive feedbacks
- E.g. pushing a boulder down a steep hill
- E.g. initial temperature increase in snow
  - warmer snow has lower albedo and absorbs more sunlight, becoming even warmer
  - warmer snow in turn warms surrounding snow
- "Domino effect"
  - Initial input causes a "snowball" effect
**** System equilibrium
***** *Steady state equilibrium*
Most systems are in *equilibrium* their conditions fluctuate around average conditions
E.g. water vapor in the atmosphere
***** *Dynamic equilibrium*
If there is a trend over time
E.g. CO_2 in the atmosphere
***** *Meta-stable equilibrium*
Abrupt change or tipping point
**** What are Earth's Systems?
***** Four Spheres interact across *500 million km^2*
- Abiotic (non-living)
  - Atmosphere
  - Hydrosphere
  - Lithosphere
- Bitotic (living): all three abiotic spheres intersect
  - Biosphere
** Location and Time on Earth
*** Dimensions
**** Spherical Planet: Earth's Dimensions
- Due to its rotation
  - Earth is not perfectly round (thicker along the equator)
  - Diameter
    - Equatorial is larger than the north-south diameter (by about 26 mi)
**** Geographic Grid
***** Latiude and Longitude
- Degrees, minutes, seconds, direction
- 0 to 180 longitude
- or 0 to 90 latitude
- 00' to 59' minutes
- 00" to 59" seconds
- N, S, E, W for direction
*** Latitude
- "Angular distance north or sourth of the equator," measured from the center of Earth
- 1 degree is *always ~69 mi*
**** Runs =east to west= on maps/globes
- Parallel to the equator (0 deg)
- Increase northward and southward
  - North Pole = 90 deg N
  - South Pole = 90 deg S
- Lines of latitude are called "parallels"
**** Latidunical Geographic Zones
- Climate latitudes
- E.g. Arctic circle: 66.5 deg N to North pole
- E.g. Antarctic circle: 66.5 deg S to South pole
- E.g. Tropic of Cancer and Capricorn: 23.5 deg N and S respectively
*** Longitude
- "Angular distance east or west of a point on the Earth's surface," measured
  from the center of Earth
- 1 degree *varies, 0-69 mi* (0 at the north pole, 69 at the equator)
**** Measured relative to prime meridian (0 deg)
- Arbitrarily designated to be Greenwich, England
**** Run =north to south= on maps/globes
- Lines of longitude are called meridians
- They are *not* parallel to each other
- Meridians make right angles with the parallels (latitudes)
*** Prime Meridian and Standard Time
**** Prime merdian, also the standard for time
- Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) = Universal Time
**** Time Zones
- Earth rotates 360 deg in 24 hours
  - *1 hour* = *1 time zone*: 360 deg / 24 hours = *15 deg wide*
  - Time zone extends 7.5 deg (15 / 2) on either side of a central meridian
- From west to east, it gets later
**** National/political boundaries distort the time zones
- Various economic and political reasons
- Some countries don't dollow the rules
  - China spans 3-4 time zones
  - Some countries observe non-standard time such as India and parts of Australia
**** International Date Line
- Where each day officially begins and sweeps westward
- Opposite the prime meridian
- West side is always one day ahead/later
- No matter what time of day you cross it, the date changes
- Remember it is a longitude line, which is inside a time zone (15 deg wide)
** Maps, Scales, and Projections
*** Map
- *Def* Generalized view of an area seen from above and reduced in size
*** Scale
- *Def* Ratio of map unites to ground units
- Representative fraction (1:250,000)
- or Graphic Scale
*** Projection
- *Def* process of transforming spherical Earth to flat map
- Often introduces distortion
**** Example
***** Mercator
- Areas are more distorted the farther they are from the equator
- Exercise: [[http://thetruesize.com]]
**** Equal area... or true shape?
- Can't have both on the same map
- Trade off between correct area and correct shape
***** Equal area
- Have to stretch and shear: parallels and meridians are no longer and right angles
***** True shape
- Scale varies from region to region across the map
**** Correct projection depends on intended use
**** Types examples
***** Cylindrical
- True shape
- Right angles
- Midlatitudes and polar areas are vastly exaggerated in size: not equal aread
- Standard line (equator on Mercator line), minimized distortion
***** Planar
- Equal area
- Standard line (point) at north pole
***** Conic
- Equal area
- Two standard parallels
** Remote Sensing and GPS
*** Remote Sensing (RS)
**** Gathering of info about objects/surfaces that are not in direct pyhsical contact
- Aircraft, spacecraft, satellites, ships, etc.
**** RS instruments are differnet portions of the electromagnetic spectrum
- Humans can only see visible spectrum
- RS can also "see" wavelengths in the ultraviolet, infrared, and/or microwave
  range
**** Satellites
***** Three types of orbits
- *Geostationary*, or geosynchronous
  - Pace the earth's rotation speed and remain "parked" over the same location
    (usually the equator)
  - Highest altitude (polar and sun-synchronous are much lower)
- *Polar*
  - Rotate north-south around earth, as earth spins under it
  - Orbit once every 90 minutes
- *Sun-synchronous*
  - Like polar-orbiters, but they shift their track slightly (1 deg) every day,
    so that they're always in daylight
***** Two types of remote sensing
- *Active* remote sensing
  - Provide their own engergy to "actively" send out a beam of enerygy, and then
    read or analyze what is sent back
  - E.g. radar
  - Can see the surface through clouds and debris, unlike passive RS
- *Passive* remote sensing
  - Record the natural radiation emitted or reflected from a surface:
    "passively wait for surface to emit its energy
  - Primarily visible and infrared light
  - E.g. areal photographs (non-flash)
  - Can give you the visual representation, unlike active RS
*** Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
**** Remote sensing produces vast quantities of spatial data...
**** GIS combines spatial and attribute data
**** Maps can contain multiple data layers
- Physical features
- Cultural features
**** Layers are added to create composite overlay
- Combining maps to aggregate all the relevant data
* Ch2: Solar Energy to Earth and the Seasons
** The Solar System, Sun, and Earth
*** Speed of light
- Travels at 300,000 km/s = 9.5 trillion km/year: *Light year*
**** Moon is 384,400 km (238,866 mi) away
  - 1.28 light seconds away
**** Solar system
  - 11 light hours in diameter
**** Milky way galaxy
  - 100,000 light years across
**** Universe
  - 12 billion light years across
*** Dimensions and distances
**** Earth's orbit
- Plane of Earth's orbit = *Plane of the ecliptic*
- Average distance from Earth to Sun: 150,000,000 km
  - About 8:20 minutes from the Sun
  - Closest in January (Perihelion)
  - Farthest on July 4 (Aphelion)
  - *Distance from Earth to Sun does not have a strong effect on seasonality*
** Solar Energy: From Sun to Earth
*** Solar activity and solar wind
**** Energy/radiation coming from sun is key to life
**** Sun 'produces'
- *Sunspots* caused by magnetic storms (huge, often bigger than size of earth)
  - activity cycle of ~11 years (maximum and minimum of radiation)
- *Solar wind* streams of electrically charged particles
  - Earth's magnetosphere deflects it toward poles
  - Neutralized in the atmosphere, doesn't reach the surface
  - Responsible for the Aurora Borealis (which is why it's only seen in the
    higher latitudes)
- *Radiation* energy in the form of *electromagnetic waves*
  - Made up of different wavelengths (short and long waves refer to wavelength)
    - *wavelength* distance over which a wave's shape repeats
    - *frequency* number of waves per unit time
  - All objects radiate energy in wavelengths related to their _temperature_
*** Electromagnetic spectrum
- Wavelengths shorter than visible light spectrum are very harmful to humans
  (ultra-violet and shorter)
- Visible light (0.4 micrometers to 0.7 micrometers)
- Wavelengths longer than visible spectrum (infrared and longer)
**** All objects with a *temperature greater than absolute zero* radiate energy
- Absolute zero = *0 Kelven (0K)* = *-273 deg C* = *-460 deg F*
**** Sun = temperature of 6000K: emits a lot of radiation
- Hot enough to give off shortwave radiation, aka *solar radiation*
- Nothing else in the solar system is hot enough to do this
- 8% ultraviolet, 47% visible, 45% infrared (all shortwave)
**** Earth = temperature of 288K: emits a lot less
- Longwave radiation, aka *terrestrial radiation*
- All infrared (all shortwave)
**** Earth's Energy Budget
- *Solar constant* = *1372 W/m^2*
- Earth absorbs shortwave from the sun
- Earth then converts the energy to longwave energy and emits that
*** Insolation
**** Incoming Energy
***** Only *one two-billionth* of sun's energy is intercepted by Earth
- INcoming SOLar radiATION = *in sol ation*
- Not to be confused with inSULation
***** Earth's *curvature* results in *uneven insolation*
- Places where the sun's rays are *perpendicuar* receive *more intense insolation*
- *Tropics* receive more concentrated insolation due to Earth's curvature
  - Approximately 2.5 times more than at poles!
- Consider a flashlight outputting a concentrated disk when shined straight as
  opposed to outputting a less concentrated oval when shined at an angle
  - More intense radiation when the light output is concentrated in a disk
***** What causes variability in insolation?
****** Sun's position:
******* Sun's altitude
- /angle above horizon/
- changes in course of day
- 0 deg at sunrise/sunset, 45 deg if half-way, or 90 deg if directly overhead
******* Sun's declination
- /latitude of overhead sun/
- changes in course of season
- sun can only every be directly overhead in tropics
  - 23.5 deg N (Tropic of Cancer) - 23.5 deg S (Tropic Capricorn
- *affects _intensity_ of insolation*
****** Day length
- number of hours of sunshine
- varies with latitude
  - no variability at equator
  - greatest variability at the poles
- *affects _amount_ of insolation*
***** What brings about these changes?
Seasons!
** The Seasons
*** Seasonality
*** Reasons for seasons
**** Revolution
- Refers to the *earth's orbit around the sun*
- *One revolution takes 365.25 days*
**** Rotation
- *spin of Earth on its own axis*
- rotation = *counterclockwise (eastward)*
- *causes daily cycle of daylight and darkness*
  - "circle of illumination"
- *one rotation per 24 hours*
**** Tilt of Earth's axis
- axis is tilted 23.5 deg from plane of ecliptic
**** Axial parallelism
- tilt is "fixed" - axis maintains alignment during entire orbit
- north pole points toward the North Star (Polaris)
**** Sphericity
- Remember earth's curvature results in uneven isolation
*** Annual march of the seasons
**** Summer solstice - June 21
- North. Hem. tilted maximally _toward_ the sun
- Overhead sun at *Tropic of Cancer* (23.5 deg N)
  - farthest north
- Longest day and shortest night (in North. Hem.)
**** Fall equinox - September 22
- Neither hem. tilted toward/away from the sun
- Overhead sun at *Equator* (0 deg)
- 12 hours day/night everywhere
**** Winter solstice - December 21
- North. Hem. tilted maximally _away from_ the sun
- Overhead sun at *Tropic of Capricorn* (23.5 deg S)
  - farthest south
- Shortest day and longest night (in North. Hem.)
**** Spring equinox - March 21
- See fall equinox
* Ch3: Earth's Modern Atmosphere
** Compounds of the atmosphere
*** Athmosphere is a very thin layer of gases
- If earth = size of an apple, atmosphere = thickness of the skin
*** Without it, no life on earth
- protective filter
  - Remember sun emits harmful long wave radiation
- maintains temperature
*** Atmospheric pressure
**** All of the gases are held down by gravity
- Gravity compresses air (denser near the surface)
- Air thins rapidly with altitude
- Pressure *decreases exponentially* with height
- Pressure is *highest at sea level*
***** Sea level pressure
- 1 kg/cm^2
- 29.92 in. Hg
- *1013.25 mb* /mean sea-level pressure/
**** 50% of atmospheric mass is in bottom 5.5 km (3.4 mi)
**** 99.9% is below 50 km (31 mi)
** Profile of the atmosphere
- Atmosphere extends to *32,000 km* (20,000 mi) from surface
  - *Exosphere* extremely few hydrogen and helium atoms are still held by
    gravity
  - *Thermosphere* at 480 km (300 mi) is the top of *principal* atmosphere
*** Ways to categorize atmosphere
**** Composition
***** /Heterosphere/ *outer atmosphere*
- Begins at 80 km (50 mi) and goes up
- <0.001% of the atmosphere
- Gases sorted by gravity, "heterogeneous"
  - stratified by atomic weight
  - "think oil and water stratified: oil floats on top separated"
***** /Homosphere/ *inner atmosphere*
- Gases evenly/well mixed, concentrations are "homogeneous"
- Extends from surface to 80 km (50 mi)
****** Homogeneous gases
- Nitrogen: 78%
- Oxygen: 21%
- CO_2: 0.039%
- Argon: 0.9%
- Trace: 0.06%
**** Temperature
***** Thermosphere
- 80 km outward
- Coinicides with heterosphere
- Temperature very high (2200 def F), but very little heat
***** Mesosphere
- Temperature decreases, *lowest temperatures* in the atmosphere (-90 deg C =
  -130 deg F)
- 50 to 80 km (30 to 50 mi)
- Top of the mesosphere = *mesopause*
***** Stratosphere
- Temperatures increase, from -57 deg C (-70 deg F) at bottom to 0 deg C (32 deg
  F) at the top, the *stratosphere*
- 18 to 50 km (11 to 31 mi)
***** Troposphere
- Temp dec at rate of 6.4 deg C / km (3.5 deg F / 1000 ft)
- *Where all weather occurs*
- Extends from surface to ~18 km (11 mi)
- Top of troposphere is the *trophosphere*, but *its height varies*
****** Height
- Thickness of troposphere *varies by latitude* (equator = 18 km; poles = 8 km)
  and *by season*
- Colder regions will have observe a lower troposphere than warmer regions
  - I.e. *height decreases with temperature*
**** Function
- The atmosphere is protective
  - Various harmful radiation is phased out or partially phased out by the
    atmosphere as a whole
    - UV
    - Gamma Rays
    - X-Rays
  - UV index
    - higher at lower latitudes
    - on cloudy days, UV index is lower
***** Ionosphere
- Spans across meso- and thermosphere
- Changes incoming particles from atoms to ions (ionization)
  - where auroras occur
- Absorbs cosmic rays, gamma rays, X-rays, some UV rays
***** Ozonosphere
- Part of the stratosphere
- What's so important about ozone?? Filters out much of the harmful UV radiation
****** Ozone
- Photodissociation: *O_2 + light \rightarrow O + O*
  - O + O_2 \rightarrow O_3
- Ozone *absorbs UV* ratiation:
  - O_3 + UV \rightarrow O_2 + O
- Endless process that abosorbs most of the harmful UV radiation
  - Also why temperature in stratosphere increases
****** Ozone "hole"
- Not actually a "hole," but a *thinning* of the O3 layer
- Ozone layer: normally only ~3 mm (0.1 in) thick
- *Seasonal occurrence*
- But...synthetic compounds from refrigerants, propellants, and solvents also
  end up in the stratosphere:
  - Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
  - UV radiation strips chlorine off CFCs; chlorine then bonds with oxygen
    - Cl + O \rightarrow ClO
    - ClO + O \rightarrow Cl + O_2
  - Chlorine used and re-used
    - One Cl atom can destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules
- *Montreal Protocol* (1987) has reduced and phased-out the use of CFCs
- Ozone hole may be getting smaller...but too soon to say if it's recovering
** Variable components
*** In addition to N_2, O_2, etc., atomosphere also contains
  - *variable gases* carbon dioxide and monoxide, methane, sulfur
  - *particles* smoke, ash, dust, pollen, salt
  - *chemicals* smog
*** Origin
**** Natural pollution
- *Volcanoes* sulfur oxides, particulates
- *Forest fires* carbon monoxide and dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulates
  - E.g. "slash and burn" agriculture
- *Plans* hydrocarbons, pollens
- *Decaying plants* methane, hydrogen sulfides
- *Soil* dust and viruses
- *Ocean* salt spray, particulates
**** Transported
***** Examples
****** Mt. Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines
- Particles in the stratosphere increased by 2 orders of magnitude along the
  tropical belt
- These particles spread across the globe
- Effect: global temperatures dropped
****** Saharan dust
- Turns out to be a good source of nutrients for rain forests across the Atlantic
****** Arctic Haze
- Very dry region
- Pollution never falls out of the air
**** Anthropogenic pollution
- *Anthropogenic* human caused
- *Aerosols* Small particles of dust, soot, and pollution
  - from urban/industrial pollution, agricultural fires/burning
- *Photo-chemical smog*
  - Creates nitric acid, peroxyacetyl nitrates, ozone
- *Smog and Haze*
*** Natural factors that affect air pollution
**** Local and regional
***** Volcanic landscapes
- *Vog* Volcanic Smog 
***** Mountain barriers
- Inhibits dispersing of pollutants
***** Valleys
- Temperature normally decreases throughout troposphere
- *inversion layer* layer where temperature suddenly increases
- traps polluted air beneath inversion layer (inversion layer is stable -- think
  stratosphere)
* Ch4: Atmosphere and Surface Energy Balances
** Energy Essentials
*** Insolation
- *Sun* provides the solar energy: *heats Earth's surface and atmosphere*
  - unevenly distributed in time and space
- *Transmission of energy* all radiation that /passes through/ the atmosphere
  - both _shortwave_ (in) and _longwave_ (out)
*** Pathways
- *Insolation input* all radiation received at Earth's surface
  - direct and diffuse
  - Greatest in tropics
- Not all insolation *directly* reaches the surface
  - *Scattering*
    - Change only in _direction_ of light, without altering wavelengths
    - Results in *diffuse* radiation
    - 7% of incoming energy is scattered back to space
    - Blue light is immediately scattered in atmosphere (sky is blue)
  - *Refraction*
    - Change in _speed and direction_ of light
    - When light moves from one medium (outer space) to another (atmosphere)
  - *Reflection*
    - bouncing back of energy without being absorbed
    - deflected away, unchanged, in the direction from which it came
    - *albedo* Reflective property/brightness of a surface
      - A percentage of reflected insolation
      - 0% albedo: no reflection
      - 100% albedo: all reflected
  - Everything not reflected is *Absorbed*
    - assimilation of radiation by an object, and converting shortwave to longwave
    - 69% of insolation is absorbed
      - 45% by the _surface_ (land and ocean)
      - 24% by the _atmosphere_ (gases, dust, clouds, ozone)
      - converted to *longwave* radiation
    - The other 31% is reflected away
- Either pass through clouds or bounces off,
  - Clouds keep us cool during the day, and warm at night
- Or absorbed by ground or bounces off
- When radiation is re-emitted, it is re-emitted as longwave
- When source is the sun, the radiation is shortwave
** Earth-Atmosphere Radiation Balance
- When combining net radiation with respect to albedo, atmosphere, and surface
  respectively, we have a balance between net input and net output
- *Incoming solar radiation peaks at noon*
  - Total amount varies with time of year and latitude
- *Warmest part of the day* around /3pm/
- *Temperature /lags/ the insolation*
  - warmest /mid-afternoon/ (3-4pm)
  - when incoming solar *and* emitted longwave radiation high
  - coolest right /at sunrise/
  - when there has been no incoming solar radiation the longest
- Earth's surface receives (I) shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) radiation, and
  loses (O) SW and LW
- *Net radiation* SW_I - SW_O + LW_I - LW_O
  - insolation - albedo + infrared - infrared
*** Mechanisms of Heat Transfer
- *Conduction* Molecule-to-molecule transfer
- *Convection/Advection* Energy transferred by movement: /vertically or horizontally/
*** Greenhouse Effect
- *Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb longwave radiation*
  - /Water vapor/ (H_2O_v), /Carbon dioxide/ (CO_2), /Methane/ (CH_4), and others
- *Delay* energy loss back to outer space
  - Similar to a greenhouse (glass lets solar radiation in, but traps longwave
    radiation going out
- *Clouds and Greenhouse Effect*
  - Clouds play an important role!
  - _Amount_ of clouds, and also _type_ and _height_ of clouds
  - *High* clouds means more trapping means /net warming/
  - *Low* clouds means more reflections means /net cooling/
** Surface Radiation Balance
*** Net Radiation
- *At the surface, net radiation is expended via*
  - *Latent heating (LE)*
    - latent or "hidden"
    - Heat transfer from _evaporation_ or _condensation_ of water
  - *Sensible heating (H)*
    - Heat you can sense
    - Transferred through _convection_ and _conduction_
  - *Ground heating/cooling (G)*
    - Energy flow in/out of the ground via _conduction_
    - Balanced on an annual basis
*** Sensible and Latent Heat
- *Global latent heat* is greatest over the oceans
- *Global sensible heat* is greatest over the continents
**** *Radiation budgets*
- *El Mirage, CA* hot desert (dry) location (35 deg B): /mostly sensible heat/
- *Pitt Meadows, BC* moderate, moist location (49 deg N): /mostly latent heat/
**** Net Radiation
- Earth-atmosphere system as a whole has a net radiation balance
  - Surplus in tropics
  - Deficit in polar regions
  - Balance at about 36 deg latitude
